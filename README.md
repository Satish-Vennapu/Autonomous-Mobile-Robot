# Autonomous Mobile Robot

## Introduction

Autonomous mobile robots are revolutionizing industries with their ability to operate independently without human intervention. These robots are equipped with sensors, processors, and algorithms that enable them to perceive their surroundings, make decisions, and navigate complex environments safely and efficiently.

This bachelors thesis project provided a hands-on experience to build a robot and explore various core concepts in robotics, such as Perception, Planning, Controls, and Modeling. By applying these concepts to a real robot, our ultimate goal is to achieve autonomy. This project mainly involves lane detection, parking space detection, and development of lane and park assist systems.

### Flow Diagram
The autonomous mobile robot operates independently, performing tasks by integrating fundamental robotics principles such as perception, localization, control, and navigation. The following process flow diagram offers an overview of how the robot accomplishes tasks through the integration of both software and hardware components:
